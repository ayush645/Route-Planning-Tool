## Understanding Problem Statement


The problem addressed by the Route Planning Tool MVP is the inefficiency and time consumption associated with manually planning routes for technicians attending multiple job locations. Currently, technicians often rely on manual methods or basic navigation apps that do not offer optimized routing specifically tailored for their needs. This leads to suboptimal routes, wasted time, and increased fuel consumption. By providing a basic yet functional tool for route optimization, the MVP aims to streamline the process, reduce travel time, and ultimately improve the efficiency of technicians attending multiple job locations.
